# 🥦 Vegetable Classification using Random Forest

## 📌 Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to classify vegetables based on various features using machine learning. Accurate classification of vegetables is essential in agricultural industries for sorting, packaging, and quality control. The dataset contains multiple vegetable samples labeled by type, and the goal is to train a model that can predict the correct class of a vegetable given its features.

## ✅ Solution Overview

This project uses the **Random Forest Classifier**, a powerful ensemble learning algorithm, to perform the classification. The key steps involved are:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loaded the dataset using `pandas`
   - Handled any null or missing values (if applicable)
   - Split the data into training and testing sets
   - Scaled the feature values using `StandardScaler`

2. **Model Training**
   - Used `RandomForestClassifier` from scikit-learn
   - Trained on 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20%

3. **Evaluation**
   - Measured performance using `accuracy_score` and `classification_report`
   - Achieved good accuracy and balanced precision/recall scores
